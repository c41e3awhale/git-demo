[Intro: Kanye West]
Uhh.. uhh
Uhh.. uhh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
